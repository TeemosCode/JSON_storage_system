# JSON_storage_system
• A storage system that performs CRUD operations on JSON format data and to flexibly scale to support for other data types without modifying the structure of the system code base (currently supporting 'list' type)

• Optimized storage system to rapidly query large sizes of multiple nested JSON formats in memory and return the data results in the exact format and order they were when added to the system
